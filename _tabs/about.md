**Hi, I’m Rakuram**!
<br>*Associate Architect* | *Automotive Software Enthusiast*

I’m an **Associate Architect** working in the **automotive embedded software** domain, specializing in the **AUTOSAR Diagnostics** stack. I have hands-on experience with **UDS, OBD, and OBDonUDS** protocols and work on integrating third-party stacks, as well as developing in-house features.

I’m passionate about **continuous learning** and enjoy exploring new technologies like **Rust** and **Software-Defined Vehicles**. This blog is where I share my professional journey, new learnings, projects, and insights into the automotive software world.

I shared my professional journey with a group of early career enthusiasts. Don't forget to watch the below video:
