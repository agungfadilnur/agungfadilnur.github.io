Learning **cybersecurity**, especially cryptography, is key for anyone interested in **automotive and embedded systems**. If you're eager to dive deeper into cryptography, here are three **free, must-have resources** that I highly recommend. These are gold mines of knowledge!

### 1. Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar
This is a series of 24 lectures on cryptography. If you have questions about cryptography and how it works, these lectures bundle everything together in a simple, structured manner. It covers **most of the mechanisms used in embedded systems**.
